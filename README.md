~~I use [my own
fork](https://github.com/lbrayner/neomutt/blob/nm_pretty/nm_pretty.md) of neomutt
with prettier virtual folder names for *notmuch* searches, both in the **index
display** (for each message in the index) and the **status line** (at the bottom).~~

This suggestion has been incorporated into [neomutt](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt) via
<https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/cc33407dc61d871e02edd813fb24b15ef544bc9f>.
